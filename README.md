This project automates job searching and automatically scrapes job listings from Indeed (for now) at user specification. The scraper can be set to scrape the website at a regular interval (only locally right now, TODO: deploy the program onto a server) and send report (currently set to calculate how many new jobs appeared) to a linked telegram bot.
